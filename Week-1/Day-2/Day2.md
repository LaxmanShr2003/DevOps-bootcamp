## 2. Key DevOps Metrics

- **Deployment Frequency** – How often code is deployed to production.
- **Lead Time for Changes** – Time from code commit to production release.
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** – Time taken to recover from failures.  
  *Also reflects quality of monitoring and alerting.*
- **Change Failure Rate** – Percentage of deployments that cause issues.

## 3. Case Study Documentation Structure

A standard DevOps case study/documentation includes:

1. **Introduction**  
2. **Problem Statement**  
3. **Solution**  
   - **Architecture**: Diagram with explanation  
4. **Key Metrics (Results)**  
5. **TCO Analysis (Total Cost of Ownership)**  
6. **Conclusion**

# 4. Linux for DevOps

## **Why Linux in DevOps?**
- Most DevOps tools run natively on Linux  
- Stable, open-source, secure  
- Excellent command-line automation  
- Widely used in servers, cloud, and containers  

---

## **Essential Linux Commands**

### **Navigation**
- `ls` – list files  
- `pwd` – print working directory  
- `cd` – change directory  

### **File Operations**
- `mkdir` – create folder  
- `rm` – remove file  
- `rm -rf` – force remove folder  
- `mv` – move/rename  
- `cp` – copy  

### **Viewing Files**
- `less`  
- `head`  
- `tail`  

### **Finding Stuff**
- `grep`  
- `find`  

### **Processes**
- `ps`  
- `top`  
- `htop`  
- `kill`  

### **Networking**
- `ping`  
- `curl`  
- `wget`  
- `netstat`  
- `telnet`

## 5. Linux File Permissions & Ownership

- Permissions:  
  - `r` – read  
  - `w` – write  
  - `x` – execute  

- Permission Groups:  
  - **Owner**  
  - **Group**  
  - **Others**

## 6. Hardlink vs Softlink

### **Softlink (Symbolic Link)**
- Acts like a shortcut  
- Breaks if original file is deleted  
- Command:  

### **Hardlink**
- Points directly to data on disk  
- Does NOT break if original file is deleted  
- Command:

## 7. Package Management
Examples learned today:
- `apt` – Debian/Ubuntu  
- `yum` / `dnf` – RHEL/CentOS  
- Installing, updating, and removing packages  

---

## 8. Revision Checklist
- DevOps culture  
- DevOps lifecycle  
- Linux basics  
- Essential skills for DevOps  


---

## Summary – What I Learned Today
Today I learned about DevOps culture (collaboration and trust), important DevOps practices (CI/CD, microservices, monitoring), key principles (automation, fail-fast), DevOps performance metrics, case study documentation structure, and essential Linux fundamentals including navigation, file operations, permissions, process monitoring, networking commands, package management, and links.
