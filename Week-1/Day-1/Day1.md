# Day 1 – DevOps Bootcamp

## 1. DevOps Fundamental Culture
Today I learned about the three main principles of DevOps culture:

- **Flow** – Understanding how the overall system works and how work moves from one stage to another. It focuses on improving the end-to-end process.
- **Feedback** – Getting quick and continuous feedback so issues can be identified and fixed fast.
- **Continuous Learning & Experimentation** – Encouraging learning, trying new things, improving processes, and growing through experience.
